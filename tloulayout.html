                <h2>A Game That Will Touch Your Heart</h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike most zombie games, The Last of Us focuses not only on 
                    death, blood, and destruction. The game’s story is actually 
                    one of the main elements that make it so successful and beloved
                     by many. Players get to know the main characters — Joel and 
                     Ellie — two people who have formed an unlikely yet strong 
                     partnership. They come from completely different walks of 
                     life: Joel, a long-time smuggler already accustomed to 
                     violence and death, and Ellie, still young and naïve.
The dangerous quest begins when Joel is tasked with escorting Ellie to the 
Fireflies, a group trying to find a cure for the zombie infection. What makes 
Ellie so special is her well-known immunity to it, and this is why Joel must be 
able to bring her to the Fireflies.

The exhausting journey is filled with bloodshed 
and difficult situations that only strengthen the bond between Ellie and Joel.
 While at first Joel claims he doesn’t like Ellie at all, this completely changes 
 in the second part of the game. In fact, Joel’s change of heart will be a decisive
  factor in how the game ends. There will be no spoilers about what happens in the 
  finale, but if there’s one thing players should know, it’s that The Last of Us
 makes an effort to break away from clichés and challenge people’s expectations.            </div>

            <div class="game-details-card">
                <h2>The Journey Ahead</h2>
                <p>
                    The Last of Us offers players a highly realistic depiction of what a 
                    zombie apocalypse might look like. Brutal actions in this game are, of course,
                     inevitable, as you will face zombies moving at lightning speed with only faint
                      traces of human flesh left. The conflict between the game’s characters will 
                      also force players to confront them. There are paranoid street gangs and
                       despicable soldiers who are more than willing to shoot another person rather
                        than risk becoming infected.
In short, the journey to safely deliver Ellie to the Fireflies will be far from a 
walk in the park
, so players should expect plenty of struggle and violence in this game.            </div>
